# Heart-Failure-Prediction-


üìä Project Summary
This project explores the application of supervised learning techniques on two real-world datasets: clinical records for heart failure prediction and environmental/time data for bike rental demand forecasting in Seoul. 
The aim is to build reliable predictive models using Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Neural Networks (NN), demonstrating data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning skills relevant for data science, analytics, and machine learning engineering roles.


üõ†Ô∏è Methods Used
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) including summary statistics and visualization
Support Vector Machine modeling with radial kernels
Repeated model evaluation and performance metrics: accuracy, recall, precision, F1 score, specificity, ROC AUC
Hyperparameter tuning using grid search and repeated cross-validation
Neural Network construction and training with varying hidden layers and activation functions
Variable importance analysis and visualization
